<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I got aware of this paper at the NeurIPS 2019 conference in Vancouver. You can find the official paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04358" target="_blank">here</a>, and an interactive version <a href="https://weightagnostic.github.io" target="_blank">at this link</a>. The source code is hosted in <a href="https://github.com/google/brain-tokyo-workshop/tree/master/WANNRelease" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a> — although it is a bit hard to get through it because of the directory structure.</p>

<p>The main highlight of the paper is that <em>artificially crafted neural networks with a single weight value — shared by all neurons and with no training — achieve competitive performance on popular baselines</em>. Such networks are labeled as Weight-Agnostic Neural Networks (WANNs). Before going through the paper, I recommend checking some basic concepts about simple neural network architectures, evolutionary algorithms, image classification, and reinforcement learning.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<h4 id="neural-architecture-search-nas">Neural Architecture Search (NAS)</h4>

<p>In a nutshell, the ultimate goal of NAS is to get rid of humans when selecting/designing the best architecture for a dataset. It does so by creating algorithms to automatically select the best arrangement of layers and the best hyperparameters. We can find a good number of papers dealing with this, and every approach has its strengths and weaknesses, but perhaps the one weakness they all share is the expensiveness of the training and evaluation of the neural networks. Why is this a problem? Because in a search process, we got to compare a significant number of neural architectures to see which ones perform best, based on its train/test accuracy. If we were to compare, let’s say 10, it would not be a problem if each of the networks took 2 minutes to train, but if we compare thousands of architectures then it starts being a problem.</p>

  <p>If you want to read more about NAS, I recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377" target="_blank">survey by Elsken et al.</a></p>

<h4 id="evolutionary-algorithms-eas">Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)</h4>

<p>An EA is an optimization method inspired by biological evolution. In short, it claims that, for a given problem, you can start with a set of random solutions (a population), which will be altered with some operations (crossover and mutation) so that they can “evolve” into a better solution, similar to what nature does with species.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm#Implementation" target="_blank">Wikipedia’s pseudo-code</a> summarizes the generic EA steps as follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate the initial population of organisms randomly (<strong>first generation</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong> the following <strong>regenerational steps</strong> until termination:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> the <strong>fitness of each organism</strong> in the population (i.e., a measure of their quality).</li>
      <li><strong>Select</strong> the <strong>fittest</strong> organisms <strong>for reproduction</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Breed new organisms through crossover and mutation</strong> operations to give birth to offspring.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> the fitness of <strong>new organisms</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace</strong> the <strong>least-fit</strong> organisms of the population <strong>with new organisms</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The loop of step 2 can variate in the order of the sub-steps, but this reflects the general idea.</p>

<h4 id="neuroevolution-of-augmenting-topologies-neat">NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)</h4>

<p><a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:ec02" blank="_target">NEAT (2002)</a> is an EA approach to NAS. The algorithm for Weight-Agnostic Neural Networks is highly inspired by it, thus it is convenient to take a quick look at it.</p>

<p>NEAT encodes the networks (i.e., the organisms) into <em>genomes</em>, as shown in Figure 1. A <em>genome</em> contains a list of <em>connection genes</em> which capture the topology of the network (i.e., the architecture). Each element in the list has 4 main attributes: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code> node, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out</code> node, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innovation number</code> (a counter of the latest generation in which the node was mutated). The remaining attribute (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enabled</code>) will help during the mutations because connections can change.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="/ml-summaries/static/img/posts/2019-03-10/wanns-neat-genome.png" alt="Example of a Genome in NEAT" width="75%" /></p>
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Example of a Genome in NEAT</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><br />
NEAT’s goal is to give birth to the best possible network with the next pseudo-code:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate <strong>initial population</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> times:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Compute the fitness</strong> of the organisms.</li>
      <li>Generate <strong>offspring</strong> according to fitness.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace the population</strong> with the offspring.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s understand each of the key elements.</p>

<p><strong>The initial population</strong>. NEAT considers a <em>uniform</em> first generation of <em>minimal networks</em>. A <em>minimal network</em> is one with only inputs and outputs (i.e., no hidden nodes). <em>Uniform</em> seems to mean that all the organisms are the same (fully-connected), and just the weights differ. The initial population is of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> and is kept constant through all iterations.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation of fitness</strong>. To evaluate the fitness of the organisms, NEAT clusters the population into <em>species</em> (similar topologies are put together) so that members of the same species will have similar fitness values. Given two organisms <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, NEAT proposes a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">δ = δ(x, y)</code> that measures how similar the organisms are. Hence, with a so-called <em>compatibility threshold</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">δ_t</code>, it is possible to cluster the population by comparing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">δ &lt; δ_t</code>. The fitness <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_x</code> of the organism <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, belonging to species <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_i</code>, is a function of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_i</code> and the reward <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r_x</code> of the network: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_x=f(s_i, r_x)</code>. The reward can be the accuracy of the network or any other measure of its performance in a given task. To see the actual functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">δ</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_x</code>, consult page 13 of the <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:ec02" blank="_target">NEAT paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the offspring</strong>. In each generation, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> organisms will be replaced by the offspring. The offspring is <em>per species</em>. 25% of the offspring (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A = 0.25 * N</code>) results from mutation without crossover, and (presumably) 75% (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B = 0.75 * N</code>) from reproduction (crossover + posterior mutation). The first step for reproduction is to eliminate the lowest-performing organisms from the entire population (the “lowest” criteria is not mentioned in the paper, sorry). Then, for each species <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_i</code>, the within-species fitness sum is computed: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F_i = sum_all(f_x)</code> for all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_i</code>. Next, we require the proportion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F_i</code> with respect to all species: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_i = F_i / sum_all(F_j)</code>. Each species <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_i</code> gets assigned a number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_i * B</code> of offspring. It is mating time now!</p>

<p>The specifics of mutation and crossover are as follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mutation</strong>: There are three mutation operators: <em>weight perturbation</em>, <em>add connection</em>, and <em>add node</em>. I am skipping the first one because we do not need it for WANNs. <u>Add connection</u> selects two unconnected nodes (presumably at random) and links them with a new random weight <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code>. <u>Add node</u> selects an existing connection (presumably at random too) with some weight <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w_c</code> and splits it in two, placing a new node in between. The new weights are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w_in = 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w_out = w_c</code>. The old connection is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISABLED</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Crossover</strong>: When crossing over, genomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> are lined up as shown in Figure 2. If two genes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x[i]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y[i]</code> have the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innovation number</code> they are called <em>matching genes</em>. If they are not matching, then they are either <em>disjoint</em> (if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innovation number</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x[i]</code> &lt;= <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y[i]</code>, or vice versa) or <em>excess</em> (if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innovation number</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x[i]</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y[i]</code>, or vice versa). At the time of selecting the genes for the offspring, <em>matching genes</em> are selected at random from either parent and <em>excess</em>/<em>disjoint</em> are taken from the most-fit parent (if they are equally fit then they are chosen randomly).</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p><br />
There are some specifics about the NEAT implementation that you can consult on pages 14 and 15 (section: “Performance Evaluations”) of the paper. But roughly, this is what you need to understand WANNs.</p>

<h4 id="dominance-relations">Dominance relations</h4>

<p><em>Dominance</em> is a concept from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization" target="_blank">multi-objective optimization</a>, where we want to find the optimal value (minimum or maximum) for a set of functions. That is, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min( f_1(x), f_2(x), ... , f_k(x) )</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> is the number of objectives. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x* in X</code> is called a <em>feasible solution</em>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is the <em>feasible set</em> of decision vectors. A vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z* := &lt; f_1(x*), f_2(x*), ... f_k(x*)&gt;</code> for a feasible solution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x*</code> is called an <em>outcome</em>.</p>

<p>A feasible solution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1</code> is said to (Pareto) <strong>dominate</strong> a solution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x2</code> (for minimization) if:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_i(x1) &lt;= f_i(x_2)</code> <strong>for all</strong> indices <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i in {1, 2, ..., k}</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_j(x1) &lt; f_i(x_2)</code> <strong>for at least one</strong> index <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j in {1, 2, ..., k}</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1</code> dominates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x2</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x2</code> does not improve any of the objectives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_i</code>  when compared to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1</code>, and there is at least one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_i</code> for which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1</code> is strictly better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x2</code>.</p>

<p>A solution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x*</code> is called <em>Pareto optimal</em> (a.k.a. non-dominated or Pareto efficient) if there does not exist another solution that dominates it. The set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> of Pareto optimal solutions is called <em>Pareto front</em>.</p>

<p>It is possible to group the solutions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x_i</code> in fronts. First, using the set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> we need to compute the first front <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F_1</code>. Second, we compute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X = X - F1</code>  and compute a new front <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F_2</code>. We can repeat this process until <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is empty. An efficient algorithm for this process is on <a href="http://www.dmi.unict.it/mpavone/nc-cs/materiale/NSGA-II.pdf" target="_blank">Page 3 of this paper</a> cited by Gaier and Ha.</p>

<h3 id="the-approach-in-a-nutshell">The approach in a nutshell</h3>

<p>Gaier and Ha propose a search algorithm where the constructed <strong>networks will not be trained</strong>, saving us a lot of computational resources. The core of the algorithm is <a href="#neuroevolution-of-augmenting-topologies-neat">NEAT</a> with some minor modifications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>initial population</strong> is <strong>not uniform</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>For every architecture a weight</strong> from a set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> <strong>is used</strong>. <strong>All neurons</strong> in the architecture  <strong>share this weight</strong> and the network will infer with no training whatsoever. This is repeated for each weight in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> (each trial is called a <em>rollout</em>).</li>
  <li>The <strong>fitness considers performance</strong> (without training) over the rollouts <strong>and complexity</strong> of the networks.</li>
  <li>A <strong>modified mutation operator</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The algorithm was tested for reinforcement learning and image classification tasks. We just need to elaborate on each of the modifications before looking at the main results.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-key-elements">Understanding the key elements</h3>

<h4 id="the-initial-set-of-architectures">The initial set of architectures</h4>

<p>Similarly to NEAT, the algorithm starts with <em>minimal topologies</em>. By looking at an example in the WANNs’ paper (see Figure 3) it is possible to infer a small modification on what a minimal topology is. Instead of fully connected inputs/outputs, WANNs start from <strong>a population of networks with zero hidden nodes, which have inputs <em>randomly</em> connected to outputs</strong>.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="/ml-summaries/static/img/posts/2019-03-10/wanns-minimal-net.png" alt="Example of a minimal topology" width="15%" /></p>
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Example of a minimal topology</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="the-rollouts">The rollouts</h4>

<p>The rollouts are the key aspect of how to measure the performance of the architectures. <em>A rollout</em> is the evaluation of a network with one shared weight. The weights considered are in the set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W = [-2, -1, -0.5, +0.5, +1, +2]</code>. For each weight in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code>, the network is evaluated. For RL that means obtaining a cumulative reward, and for image classification the accuracy.</p>

<p>After all evaluations, three measures are computed:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_1</code>: The average of the rollouts’ rewards/accuracies.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_2</code>: The maximum reward/accuracy among rollouts.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_3</code>: The number of connections in the architecture.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-fitness-values">The fitness values</h4>

<p>Once the rollouts are finished, the <strong>fitness</strong> is measured. The authors propose a stochastic approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20% of the time, the fitness is the rank after sorting by <em>dominance relations</em> of the objectives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_2</code>.</li>
  <li>80% of the time, the fitness is the rank after sorting by <em>dominance relations</em> of the objectives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-mutation-operators">The mutation operators</h4>

<p>The architectures mutate via <strong>three operators</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Insert new node</strong>: Same as in NEAT, but without weights and with an activation function sampled at random from the set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[linear, step, sin, cosine, Gaussian, tanh, sigmoid, absolute-value, negative linear, ReLU]</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Add new connection</strong>: Same as in NEAT, but without weights.</li>
  <li><strong>Change existing activation</strong>: An existing node is chosen (presumably at random). Then, an activation function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> is randomly selected from the set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[linear, step, sin, cosine, Gaussian, tanh, sigmoid, absolute-value, negative linear, ReLU]</code> and the node gets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> assigned.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experiments-and-results">Experiments and results</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, WANNs are tested on reinforcement learning (RL) and image classification tasks. To avoid rephrasing the paper, I limit myself to present an overview of the findings, emphasizing what I consider the most interesting. I recommend checking all the results in the <a href="https://weightagnostic.github.io" target="_blank">paper’s interactive version</a>.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</h4>

<h5 id="experiment-setup">Experiment setup</h5>

<p>The reinforcement learning tasks solved with WANNs are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CartPoleSwingUp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BipedalWalker-v2</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CarRacing-v0</code> (all of them available as <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/" target="_blank">OpenAI Gym environments</a>). For each of the tasks, a WANN is constructed by following the approach we have discussed so far. To compare the WANN’s performance, the authors use a <a href="https://worldmodels.github.io" target="_blank">fixed topology from literatue</a> as a baseline. For the two architectures, the next experiments are repeated 100 times per task:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Solve the task with random weights (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>) assigned per neuron.</li>
  <li>Solve the task after training (tuning) of random weights (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>) assigned per neuron.</li>
  <li>Solve the task with a shared random weight (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>).</li>
  <li>Solve the task after training (tuning) of a shared random weight (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>This setting makes a lot of sense to me. By comparing the performance using non-tuned random weights, we can see how dependent an architecture is on the weights. If it performs poorly, then the architecture might not be adequate for the task and relies too much on the weights. On the other hand, when tuning the weights, important things can be revealed: 1) if the architecture performed poorly with random weights but improved with tuning, then it could suggest that the tuned weights <em>hide</em> the fact that the architecture is not adequate by design; 2) if a WANN does not improve much when tuned, the topology itself might be “overfitting” (which is not necessarily a bad thing because then we could forget about <em>general-purpose</em> architectures and start designing <em>ad hoc</em> topologies for our tasks).</p>

<h5 id="results">Results</h5>

<p>The reported rewards are shown in Figure 4. In short, WANNs outperform the baseline in 11/12 experiments. In general, the baseline appears very dependent on the tuned weights (very low or even negative rewards when randomly assigned). A WANN has the same drawback for random weights but it is way more robust to a random shared weight.</p>

<p>For the rest of the analysis let’s forget about the baseline. A WANN achieves its maximum performance after tuning of non-shared weights, which also improves its variance. The reward obtained with random shared weights is still low compared to the maximum obtained and shows important variance. When the shared weight is tuned, the performance becomes more certain and importantly higher but not the highest.</p>

</figure>

<p><br />
With these numbers, it is not clear yet what the essential advantage of a WANN is. To clear this out, Gaier and Ha help us with an analysis of the topologies discovered, from which I will simply rephrase the main claims. WANNs are simple and modular. They seem to ignore non-important inputs and use fewer connections than state-of-the-art approaches. An important note made in the paper is that the complexity of the topologies increases at each generation, capturing one by one the principal elements of the task. For example, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CartPoleSwingUp</code> task, a topology from an early generation captures the position-velocity relation, and in a later generation, the same topology adds nodes on top that refine the balancing (check the <a href="https://weightagnostic.github.io" target="_blank">interactive paper</a> for an animation of this behavior).</p>

<h4 id="image-classification">Image Classification</h4>

<h5 id="experiment-setup-1">Experiment setup</h5>

<p>For Image Classification the setup changes. The task is now <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" target="_blank">MNIST</a>. This time the baselines are a simple Linear Regressor and a Two-Layer CNN. Presumably, the next steps are followed 100 times too:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Solve the task with a shared random weight (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>).</li>
  <li>Solve the task after training (tuning) of a shared random weight (drawn from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Uniform(-2, 2)</code>).</li>
  <li>Instantiate the WNN with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> different weights (without training) so that we end up with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> WNNs with the same topology and just the shared weight differing. Build an ensemble where each of these networks is given a single vote so that the predicted value for an image is the digit that received the most votes.</li>
  <li>Repeat 3, but training each member of the ensemble (I assume) individually.</li>
</ol>

<p>A strong justification for trying with an ensemble in this task is not clear to me. My impression is that since the results did not show as strong as in RL, they experimented with an alternative that could strengthen WANNs. The task itself is simple to me, considering that a simple Two-Layer CNN is already a strong baseline for MNIST.</p>

<h5 id="results-1">Results</h5>

<p>The results are in Figure 5. This time WANNs do not seem as well-performing as in the RL experiment. As I said, maybe that’s the reason behind trying with an ensemble. I do not have much to say about this experiment, just that it seems to me that there is much room for improvement in the experiment setup.</p>

<h3 id="my-feelings-about-the-paper">My feelings about the paper</h3>

<p>I really like this paper. From the moment I knew about it, I was impressed for its simplicity and power. We are always worried about the best weights of a network and put too much care in their training to compare the architectures, but this work shows that a single shared weight can help us to compare and build architectures efficiently.</p>

<p>My main takeover is that a WANN has a more adequate topology because forgetting about the weights and training makes the algorithm to focus on the arrangement of layers. However, I am a bit worried about the variance of the random shared weight (Figure 4). Also, I am not clear on the selection of the baseline for the RL tasks. Are they convenient? Are there better baselines? I must admit I did not read the baseline’s paper. If I have the time to do it, I will update this part of the summary with more insights.</p>

<p>I like the fitness function, wich uses dominance relations. By considering different objectives, the estimation of the performance looks more solid to me.</p>

<p>Concerning the image classification experiment, I have to say that I was expecting a bit more of discussion but it is great that Gaier and Ha spent time to show us WANNs in that domain too. To me, WANNs are not looking so powerful there, but it is also true that researchers have made much progress in image classification and sometimes is unfair for the novel approaches to compete with state-of-the-art architectures in the field, even though they have excellent ideas as it is the case of Gaier and Ha.</p>

<p>In general, I think it would be good to see how other search methods (e.g. RL) behave with WANNs, specially because of the recent success of NAS with RL. I would also like to see the running times, because although the search does not look expensive, solving the RL environments could be. As it is the case with some papers from the Big Guys, the results look amazing but the computational resources could be out of our reach.</p>

<p>This is all for my summary. I hope this helps you to understand and possibly implement the paper. Do not forget to share :)</p>

<!-- ### Conclusions -->

<!-- Parsing JSON with Ruby is actually extremely easy. All you have to do is have the json gem installed (`gem install json`) and call the `JSON.parse` method on the JSON data to convert it to ruby hashes. If you look at this small program here, you can see how I have implemented parsing JSON in Ruby.
