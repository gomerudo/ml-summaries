# About the founder

Hi! My name is Jorge. My degree says I am a Data Scientist, but I prefer to see myself as a Machine Learning Engineer (a.k.a. Data Science Engineer) because I really cannot see Data Science in the same way that traditional job descriptions describe it.

# The short story



The _ML summaries_ started in early 2020. My motivation was very simple: help others to understand Machine Learning (ML) best papers without struggling too much, ideally in just on read!

# A more elaborated story

Well, you migh say that is a cliché in the world of ML blogs. If you think so, I must admit you are right... But I like to believe there is something that makes the _ML summaries_ different from other blogs: my formation when I entered the ML ecosystem was not that of a data scientist, nor a mathematician, nor a physician, and **I really really struggled getting there!** I was a computer scientist that finished his bachelor when machine learning was just starting and it was rarely introduced in most of the universities. I mean, when I did my bachelor around 2010, the main aspiration of us, the average computer scientists, was to become a web developer, master hibernate or spring, learn everything about agile methodologies, and all that amazing stuff (I genuinely believe that) that was the interest back then and which made the web such a comfortable place. So, even if we had good mathematical backgrounds in college, or if we were lucky enough to had been introduced to (now) old machine learning models, it was not something you really used while learning Java EE. The job market needed developers and that is what we became.

So, when I decided to pursue a master in Data Science in 2017 – 5 years after my last mathematics course – I struggled understanding all those groundbreaking papers that talked about softmax, backpropagation, cross-entropy, bayesian learning, LSTMs, reinforcement learning, and uncountable others. I struggled remembering my basic statistics, and understanding more elaborated ones that I had never seen. I hardly remembered what the gradient or the central limit theorem were. Plus, after sometime I realized I was not the only one struggling with that. In particular, every single person that was educated before the boom of Machine Learning was struggling in similar ways.

During that journey I realized something: thinking as a developer eventually helped me to structure my new ML knowledge a bit better, and also made a difference in my ML contributions. I believe that a great skill that software engineers have is tha ability to think in boxes. The ML summaries is born with that idea in mind, so that people with a similar background can have a new perspective of how ML can be understood too. Perhaps, for some ML practitioners writting in mathematical terms is straightforward to understand, but some of us prefer to understand ideas in a different way because the other way is not as straightforward. Sometimes we need the author to remember us the basic ideas that might not be as clear now. Sometimes, we would love to have a better starting point to understand an idea that would take weeks to grasp if were to do it alone. And the box thinking come really handy in that!

But enough talking! I hope that this explanation helps to understand the key idea of the _ML summaries_ blog. If you feel my story relatable, then you could also join me in this quest!

I hope you enjoy the summaries, and good luck in your ML journey!
